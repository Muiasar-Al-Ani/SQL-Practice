Welcome to another Career Connection! This unit is tackling Structured Query Language, or SQL for short.

Your first exposure to SQL can be a little overwhelming, especially in the beginning, because a lot of errors can arise during setup. But once you've got it working, Structured Query Language is immensely useful.

> **Nerd Note**: You’ll find that some people pronounce SQL as “S-Q-L,” while others call it “sequel.” Each pronunciation is completely valid!

### Flavors of SQL

If you search "SQL developer" on Indeed.com, you'll find that MySQL isn’t the only type of SQL out there. In fact, you’ll likely see the following terms:

- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB

This list is by no means exhaustive&mdash;many other SQLs exist. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter.

Why’s that? Well, the various SQLs aren’t all that different from each other. If you concentrate on fully understanding the concepts of MySQL, like reading, writing, deleting, and updating data, and creating joins and relationships between data, then you'll be set to interview for any position requiring knowledge of any kind of SQL database.

### Looking to the Future

Now let's look at some real-life SQL database use cases.

In the [2019 Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), SQL was ranked the third most popular language used by developers. Only JavaScript and HTML/CSS&mdash;which serve totally different purposes&mdash;outranked SQL.

The same survey shows that MySQL is by far the most popular version of SQL, favored by 54% of respondents compared to the next most popular, at 34.3%.

And if all that doesn’t win you over to the world of relational databases and MySQL, Indeed.com consistently reports [average salaries of over $90,000 for SQL developers ($91,412 in 2020)](https://www.indeed.com/career/sql-developer/salaries).

### Employer-Ready Moment

If you haven't already, write that resume! Once you’ve submitted it for review, a Profile Coach will look for the following criteria before marking your resume as employer-ready:

- Your name, phone number, professional email address (not Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL, or a school address), city, state, zip code, and written-out hyperlinks to LinkedIn, GitHub, and your portfolio

- A technical skills section that conforms to standard spelling and style for programming languages and technologies

- Brief descriptions of three of your strongest projects, including languages used and written URLs to the GitHub repos and deployed projects

- Your professional experience in reverse chronological order, listing job title, job description, company name, city and state, and dates of employment

- Boot camp listed as the most recent item in education, under "Certificate"

- No templated language, like “TBD” or “TODO”

- Consistent punctuation and correct grammar and spelling

Once you've checked your resume for all of the preceding criteria, submit it to your Profile Coach.

### Technical Interview Preparation

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

- Coding Algorithm #1: Multiply into 20

- Coding Algorithm #2: Zeroes and Ones

- Coding Algorithm #3: Merge Sorted

For practice in a live, interview-style IDE, complete the following algorithm challenge. The solution will be discussed in the weekly recommended session.

Once you start, you'll have seven days to complete it. After seven days, the challenge will close.

- CodeSignal Algorithm: [Camel Case Separation](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/Az2qBBpbLLktvi6MR/6KJ2ebjXrCiSPo)
