# Unit 12: SQL

## Overview

This week, youâ€™ll add the final layer to your tech stack: the database. Storing and retrieving data quickly and efficiently makes databases the foundation of full-stack web applications. In this unit, youâ€™ll learn to design a MySQL database capable of storing large amounts of data as well as the tools needed to create, read, update and delete data. You will also learn to connect your MySQL database to a Node.js application using an Express.js server. 

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-getting-started.html)

* [Creating and selecting a database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-database.html)

* [Creating tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html)

* [SELECT statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html)

* [INSERT statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html)

* [UPDATE statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html)

* [DELETE statement](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/delete.html)

* [Connecting MySQL to Node.js app using mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

* [Data types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html)

* [Schemas](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/schema.htm)

* [Seeds](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/loading-tables.html)

* [Primary keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/constraint-primary-key.html)

* [Foreign keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html)

* [Prepared statements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-prepared-statements.html)

* [Aggregate functions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html)

* [Joins](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/join.html)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Use MySQL Shell to execute commands.

* Create a database schema.

* Seed a database for use in application development.

* Perform CRUD functions using MySQL commands.

* Specify the relationship between tables using primary and foreign keys.

* Write a SQL query that joins two tables together.

* Implement `?` prepared statements in conjunction with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`

* Perform a calculation on a set of values using aggregate functions.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [02: Zeroes and Ones](./03-Algorithms/02-zeroes-and-ones)

* [03: Merge Sorted](./03-Algorithms/03-merge-sorted)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL2.

## Career Connection

Career Services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you will learn to use Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify your MySQL queries and easily handle data in a full-stack app.
