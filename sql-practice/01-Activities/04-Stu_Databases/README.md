## 💡 Hints

Which statement can we use to show all databases?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* SQL is a **relational database management system**, or **RDBMS**. What are the characteristics of an RDBMS? What other database systems fall into the category of RDBMS?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
