# 📖 Implement Data Types and Constraints

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to limit each column so that it accepts only one type of data.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when each column in the `customers` table has a defined data type and constraint.

* It's done when the values in the `id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` columns cannot be `NULL`.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MySQL documentation on data types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html)

## 💡 Hints

If no value is supplied to a column, what value is set by default?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* MySQL constraints are classified as either column-level or table-level constraints. What is the difference?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
